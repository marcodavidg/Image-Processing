# Homework 1

The purpose of this assignment is to explore and implement digital enhancement and restoration techniques that can improve an image that is noisy or has lightning problems to obtain a cleaner and better image.

The main objectives of this assignments are the following:
• Implement digital image improvement and enhancement algorithms discussed during class.
• Implement improvements to these methods to obtain even better results than their corresponding original algorithm.
• Learn the difference of implementing methods for different images represented in different color models. 

## Methods used:
- Histogram equalization
- Order-statistics filters for impulse noise - Median filters
- Sharpening spatial filters - Laplacian filter
- Power-law transformations
- Gaussian smoothing filter

## Results:
